There are a number of platforms supporting the interface to the Bosch BMP0805 pressure sensor, Arduino and Rasberry Pi  to name two.

The STM Discovery boards have much to offer and so this project should give others a useful starting point to get their code working quickly.

The Atollic Lite environment was used to since it is easily configured to run the Discovery board.

Eclipse could be configured manually but it is a tedious process and for small pieces of code it is not worth the time.
