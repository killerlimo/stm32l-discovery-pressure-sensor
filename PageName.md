# Requirements #

The requirements are very simple:

1. Interface the STM32L Discovery board to the Bosch BMP0805 pressure sensor.

2. The display should be capable of showing:

  * temperature
  * pressure (in HPa)
  * altitude (in ft assuming 1013 HPa standard pressure)

3. The user button should be used to control which parameter is displayed.
